## Folder/File structuring

- Ensure all implementations stay in their related folders and files

- Make sure to split pages into views or partials. Do not bloat pages with code. Avoid redundancy as much as possible

Dedicated branches must be created for each issue that's assigned to you. Ensure that each branch is checked out of the latest version of the `main` branch. The branch must be named according to the issue number. For example, `issue-1`
